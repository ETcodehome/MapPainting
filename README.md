This project produces a plugin for Java Minecraft servers that allows users to "paint" in an immersive way inside Minecraft.

Players buy and mix different coloured paints, then use those paints on special canvases to generate amazing artworks that massively enhance player experiences by allowing them to customise the world around them.

# CURRENTLY WIP
The plugin is currently being updated from a local branch that has been in use for a number of years back into alignment with the source branch. 
I would recommend waiting for a formal release rather than using it in its current state.

# Branch Philosophy
Produce a Minecraft plugin for painting on maps inside the game.
Do what it does well and remove feature creep that is distracting from the plugins core promise.
In line with this, a lot of features that distracted from map painting have been stripped from this branch.

# Configuration

# Localization
Creep and multiple developers has left regional localization in a pretty poor state. 
Efforts are being made to return the plugin to full localization support but there are large numbers of non-localized strings and uncustomizable values currently.

# Valid Colors

This plugin wouldn't have been possible without all past contributors, and the original plugin author.
